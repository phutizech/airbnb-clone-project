## API Security

### Key Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication
**Implementation**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with secure token storage and refresh token rotation
**Purpose**: Ensures only verified users can access protected endpoints by validating user identity through encrypted tokens

#### 2. Authorization
**Implementation**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with middleware validation
**Purpose**: Restricts user actions based on their roles (guest, host, admin) to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive operations

#### 3. Rate Limiting
**Implementation**: Express-rate-limit middleware with IP-based and user-based throttling
**Purpose**: Prevents brute force attacks, DDoS attempts, and API abuse by limiting requests per time window

#### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
**Implementation**: Joi validation schemas and express-validator middleware
**Purpose**: Protects against SQL injection, XSS attacks, and malformed data by validating and cleaning all incoming requests

#### 5. HTTPS & SSL/TLS Encryption
**Implementation**: SSL certificates and forced HTTPS redirects
**Purpose**: Encrypts data in transit between client and server to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks

#### 6. CORS Configuration
**Implementation**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing settings with whitelisted domains
**Purpose**: Controls which external domains can access the API to prevent unauthorized cross-site requests

#### 7. Helmet.js Security Headers
**Implementation**: Helmet middleware for setting security-related HTTP headers
**Purpose**: Protects against common web vulnerabilities by setting appropriate security headers

### Security Importance by Area

#### User Data Protection
**Why crucial**: Personal information, payment details, and identification documents must be protected to prevent identity theft, comply with GDPR/CCPA regulations, and maintain user trust.

#### Payment Processing Security
**Why crucial**: Financial transactions require PCI DSS compliance to prevent fraud, protect credit card information, and ensure secure monetary transfers between parties.

#### Property Management Security
**Why crucial**: Hosts' property information, availability calendars, and pricing data must be secured to prevent unauthorized modifications and protect business operations.

#### Booking System Integrity
**Why crucial**: Booking records and reservation details must be protected against tampering to maintain transaction integrity and prevent fraudulent activities.

#### Review System Authenticity
**Why crucial**: Review data must be secured to prevent fake reviews, maintain platform credibility, and ensure genuine user feedback.

### Additional Security Practices
- **Regular security audits** and penetration testing
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** with npm audit
- **Environment variable protection** for sensitive credentials
- **Database encryption** at rest and in transit
- **API key rotation** and secure storage
